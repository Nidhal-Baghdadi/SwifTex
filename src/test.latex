In mathematics, a **vector space** \( V \) is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce another vector in the same space. A vector \( \mathbf{v} \in V \) is often represented as:
\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix}
\]

The dot product of two vectors \( \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V \) is given by:
\[
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i v_i
\]

### Matrices

A matrix \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \) is represented as:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{pmatrix}
\]

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix \( A \) is given by:
\[
\text{det}(A) = \begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
\]

### Calculus

In calculus, the **derivative** of a function \( f(x) \) at a point \( x_0 \) is defined as:
\[
f'(x_0) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
\]

The **integral** of a function \( f(x) \) over an interval \( [a, b] \) is given by:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
\]

For example, the integral of \( f(x) = x^2 \) from 0 to 1 is:
\[
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Series and Summations

The **infinite series** \( S \) of a sequence \( a_n \) is expressed as:
\[
S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n
\]

For example, the geometric series for \( |r| < 1 \) is given by:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n = \frac{1}{1 - r}
\]

### Probability and Statistics

In probability theory, the **variance** of a random variable \( X \) is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean \( \mu \), defined as:
\[
\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
\]

For a normal distribution with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \), the probability density function is:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)
\]

### Limits and Continuity

A function \( f(x) \) is **continuous** at \( x = c \) if:
\[
\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)
\]

The **limit** of a function \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches infinity is:
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)
\]

For example, the limit of the harmonic series diverges:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = \infty
\]

### Differential Equations

A **first-order differential equation** can be written as:
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
\]

The general solution to the **homogeneous** differential equation \( y' - y = 0 \) is:
\[
y(x) = C e^x
\]
where \( C \) is a constant determined by initial conditions.
